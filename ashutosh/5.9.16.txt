Topic: Some question that needed to be answerd
Source: google
Description
1)What is cryptography?
  Cryptography is basically a field of information system in which we deal with 
  the secure transfer of information from one party to second party in presence
  of third party. Before getting into any background detail let me tell u that
  first party is the source from which the information needs to be generated
  while second party in the target to which the information is to be sent and
  third party in outsider
2)How cryptography is implemented?
  To implement first an information is generated by the first party,
  then it is encoded in some other form then it is sent to the target user where
  it is further decoded by the target to understand the information
   for ex: if i send an information "my name is ashutosh" , now my encoding process
           is such that each charchter is shifted by next third letter
 	   hence information would be such "pb qdph lv dvkyxrvk" 
	   bascically this is decoded by the reciever and message is sent, by chance if
           this message is recieved by someone else he would not understand it
3)Aspect of cryptography usage:
  information security 
  data confidentiality
  data integrity  
  authentication
  non-repudiation
4)what is stagnography?
  Stagnography is one  step advancement of cryptography, in cryptography message is modulated
  hence if third party get attention they can decode it. But in stagnography message is sent
  in the hidden form in the physical media such as vedio,audio or image which do not attract
  attention of third party easily, hence it is way safer than cryptography
5)why was the name mongodb used?
  actually mongodb wasmade by the company named 10gen, this company was facing problem on data handling
  when they were working on a project assosiated with cloud computing similar to that of google, so as a
  startup they descided to make a software that could solve their problem as well as of other's as many 
  faced same problem. Initially they descided to name it after the name of their developer Eliot and Dwight
  as Ed and since they were going to handle database so they decided to use db
  and since they were going to handle enormus (humongus) data they named it as mongoDb
