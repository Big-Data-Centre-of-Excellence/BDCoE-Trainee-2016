3) It provides replication feature, hence for each set of data there exist at least 2 copies
4) It can be used in file storing
5) Used for the aggrigation of data

Basically whole of the system is based on the "MAster / Slave " System, which means
that there exist one master for the database, and rest are its slaves. Hence
master gets a task from the user , in return master divides the work amongst its slaves
this process is called as "LOAD BALANCING". 
Functioning of all the slaves is checked by the procees of "HEARTBEAT" checkup
master sends a pulse to each of its slaves in every 3 sec, in return slaves has to
send back the pulse within 9 sec, in case any of the slave fails to send bacl pulse
its work is assigned to some othher slave
