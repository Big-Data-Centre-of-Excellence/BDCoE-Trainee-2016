Topic : commands related to mongoDB
Source: tutorials point
Description:
1)insert(): this command is used is used to insert data in mongoDb collection
    Syntax:db.database_name.insert({data})
    Example:db.student.insert({"name":"AShutosh"})
2)find(): this command is used to querry data in mongoDb, using this command all 
the documents will be displayed but in an unstructured manner
      example: db.student.find()
note: if we use pretty() function further then the result is displayed in the formatted manner
now if we give parameters inside find() function, we can use filtere querries
      example: db.students.find({marks:{$gt:90}}) this querries results in display of all students above 90
               db.students.find({marks:{$lt:40}}) this querry result in display of students having marks less than 40
similarly we have criteria for equality db.students.find({marks:55})
we can have querry for range wise operations also db.students.find({marks:{$gt:55, $lt:75}})
use of "or" in querring data 
       db.students.insert({"name":"Ashutosh"}{"Marks":"90"})
use of "and" in querrying from database
       db.students.insert({"name":"Ashutosh","Marks":"90"})
we can also use "and" and "or" together in a querry
       db.students.insert({"marks":{$gt:40},$or[{"name":"Ashutosh","name":"Anand"}]})
3)update(): As the name indicates this method is used to update a record in the databse
       Syntax: db.databse_name.update(selected criteria, updated data)
       for example: db.students.update("name:"Ashutosh","last_name":"Anand")
basically this method updates one document at a time in case we have to update multiple data then we have to use multi keyword
       for example: db.students.update({marks:{$gt:40}},{$set{"status":"Pass"}},{multi:true})
4)save(): this method is used to save the updated field, basically old file is replaced with the new one
       Syntax:db.students.save({object_Id,new data})
5)remove(): this method is used to remove a data from the database
basically there are two parameters assosiated with this method
criteria: this parameter is optional, and is used to assign the criteria to remove data
justOne: this parameter is also optional and is used to speicfy weather multiple deltion is allowe dor not, which is further specied by 1(true), 0(false)
       Syntax: db.Databse_name.remove(deltion_criteria, 1/0)
if db.database_name.remove()
is used then whole of the document in the collection is deleted

Doubts: use of $sign?
        it is used in querry such as $gt,$lt,$or
        not getting why is it used, also the text after $ does it has to be to be certain keyword or any text is considerd
