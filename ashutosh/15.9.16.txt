MODIFIERS:   These allow us to edit a document's values,based on what's its current value is.For example
                           adding values to the end of an array.
BATCH INSERT:    Multiple documents can be inserted in mongo db using batch inserting operations.

TTL concept :TTL indexes are special single field indexes that mongoDB can use to automatically remove docs from 
                       a collection after a certain amount of time.Data expiration is useful for certain types of information 
                       like machine generated event data,logs and session information that only need to persist in a database
                       for a finite amount of time.To create a TTl index use the db.collection.createIndex() method 
                       with thw expireAfterseconds option.

                                                                                collection but in the same database can have same _id.
