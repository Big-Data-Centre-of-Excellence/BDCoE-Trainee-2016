Description: 
  Basically mongodb  is scalable, open souce, high performance,"Document Oriented Database"
Database is categorized in 3 forms:
1)Relational Database Management System(RDBMS):
This is the conventianl database in which each and evey entry of the databse are logically 
or some other way connected to each other
2)OLAP(Online Analytic Processing):
It is the multimedia analysis of a bussiness transaction. It helps us to process multimedia data
such as extraction of the data from a graph and doping its analysis
3)NoSql database:
It stands for not only sql database, this database is non relational as the name indicates
hence it is usefull in analysis of data from a database which is not related as conventional
Features of nosql database:
1)it provides horizontal scalability, which means data can be easily handeled using distributed computing
2)It works on master and slave conviction

Disadvantage of nosql db over conventianl or sql datbase
1)nosql db does not allow join, which means 2 or more tables cant be joined directly using join commands
2)complex transactions are not supported , such as - taking few names from the table, then sorting it, deleting
few elements and adding some more and so on
3)constarints are not supported, which imposing a set of rules for data filling is not supported

Advantages of nosql db
1)It is a querry language, inspite of being so generalized in terms of data evalution, queery is applicable too
2)fast performance is available due to the distributed computing
3) horizontal scalabilty is availabilty 
4)storing and analysis of data is easy for example whle mainbtaing a datbase there is no compulsion for number
of entries to be same for each subsiquent data node
5)It has provision for storing locational data such as latitudes and longitudes, hence using this many implications 
can be done such as finding things in radius of few kms or finding the range of extent of volcanic erruption etc

The most important i believe, i was able to get was that:-
for the use of oops based language in data handling, ie data addition and implimentation
In a rdbms if there are multiple database, entry is not easy because there is recquirement of object conversion
by thye compiler,which means we have to specify properties of data before they are added to there respective tables
But in case of mongodb object conversion is not recquired by the complier, hence data is directly added and implimented

Application of Mongodb:-
1)it is used form maintaing user account data
2) maintaing form data
3)content management process
4)it is suitable for geological data managemnet and analysis
5)used for storing and evaluating logarithmic data
6)used for application configuration

Doubts- none
