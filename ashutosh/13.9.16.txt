Description:
multithreading in java can be useful in solving issues relating to
multitasking,multiusers,multiprocessing
bascically each and every program is itself a thread
main function is the smallest thread
hence a thread is a smallest individual code existing having capabilty to use some of the resources of system
but the problem arises when several threads try to use the resouces simultaniously
which can be done using cpu scheduling
in order to execute each and every program there is always an issue which program will be executed first, and which will be the next
this is descide by scheduling of os. but if set priority we can tell our system which program to start first , but there is no gaurantee
of the process to end first

2)Runnable: it is an interface class ehich is inherited in the current class to set the architecture of our thread
3)run: this is the function of thread which is use to code for thead
