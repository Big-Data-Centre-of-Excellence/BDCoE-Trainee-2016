Note:- concept of object id
object id of any document is 12 byte hexadecimal unique number to identify a particular document
12 bytes is divided as foloow
first 4 bytes is the time stamp of the document
next 3 bytes is the machine id
next 2 bytes is the process id
next 3 bytes is the increment id or factor
so basically object id is recognization factor
what if id is unknow?
how to insert the doument
we can use db.post.save(document_name) to insert the document in database
6)createCollection(): this command is used to create collection as the name indicates
   Syntax:db.createCollection(name, option)

   option:this field is optional, it defines the properties of the collection
           -> capped: it is a boolean entity, which enables us to specify the limit of data
                     for example: marks of any subject can not be exceede above 100
           -> autoindexID: this field is used for indexing
