Doubt:

Given n numbers.How to make all possible combination of k numbers

for example:
if input is 10,20 30,40
and it is asked for k=2
output should be
{10,20},{10,30},{10,40},{20,30},{20,40},{30,40}

******************
Hint:
If n numbers and you have to find all possible combination of k numbers then you calculate on nCk for that.

1. Calculate nCk and store the value in L
2. Then use two nested for loop to print the desire output
